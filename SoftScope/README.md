# SoftScope
A software based Oscilloscope / Vectorscope

SoftScope is an attempt to mimic the functionality of a two channel oscilloscope, where each channel is fed from an stereo audio source.
The result, when used with the [appropriate audio source](http://oscilloscopemusic.com/), is a vector drawing machine:
